RedTape proves that government interaction doesn’t need to be fragmented.

With one portfolio twin, one universal chat, and one actionable checklist, we’ve shown how Australians can navigate tax, services, data, and regulations in a single, trusted experience.

Every answer is personalised, explainable, and backed by official government data — from the ATO to the ABS to the Federal Register of Legislation.

And because it’s unified, one question often touches multiple domains at once — tax, services, compliance, and data insights — so nothing slips through the cracks.

This is more than a prototype: it’s a model for how government could deliver seamless, citizen-first services in the future.

One assistant. Four challenges. One solution.

That’s RedTape.


Welcome to RedTape — the AI assistant that helps Australians navigate compliance with confidence.
This isn’t just another chatbot. It’s one assistant that covers everything government.

EXPLAIN CHALLENGE AREA

RedTape answers with clarity and trust. Every response is backed by official datasets, registers, and legislation, explained in plain English, and turned into an actionable checklist.

And the key is the unified experience

	1.	You set up your portfolio twin once — enter your ABN, study status, visa, or dependants.
	2.	You ask anything. One question like ‘What do I need as a new business?’ will automatically cover tax, compliance, available services, and industry data together.
	3.	All obligations go into one checklist: tax deadlines, service eligibility, licences, permits — everything in one place.”
